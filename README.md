# building-a-hybrid-movie-recommender
This project explores how hybrid recommender systems can improve recommendation quality by combining collaborative filtering and latent structure discovery. Using the MovieLens dataset, I implement and compare PCA- and SVD-based approaches, examining their strengths, limitations, and practical tradeoffs in sparse user–item settings.
